=================================
 Enabling Searchlight in Devstack
=================================

1. Download DevStack

2. Add this repo as an external repository::

     > cat local.conf
     [[local|localrc]]
     enable_plugin searchlight https://github.com/openstack/searchlight
     enable_service searchlight-api
     enable_service searchlight-listener

2. Customize searchlight configuration

To customize the searchlight configuration, add settings under the following
section in ``local.conf``::

    [[post-config|$SEARCHLIGHT_CONF]]

3. Add Plugin Configuration Hooks

The search service is driven using a plugin mechanism for integrating to other
services. Each integrated service may require additional configuration
settings. For example, typically, you will need to add the
``searchlight_indexer`` notification topic to each service's configuration.

Please review the plugin documentation and add configuration appropriately:

 * `Searchlight Plugins <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/searchlight/plugins.html>`_

4. Run ``stack.sh``

.. note::
   This installs a headless JRE. If you are working on a desktop based OS
   (such as Ubuntu 14.04), this may cause tools like pycharms to no longer
   launch. You can switch between JREs and back: to a headed JRE version using:
   "sudo update-alternatives --config java".
