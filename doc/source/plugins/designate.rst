Designate Plugin Guide
**********************

Integration is provided via a plugin. There are multiple configuration
settings required for proper indexing and incremental updates. Some of the
settings are specified in Searchlight configuration files. Others are
provided in other service configuration files.

Searchlight Configuration
=========================

Searchlight resource configuration options are shown below with their
configuration file and default values.

See :ref:`searchlight-plugins` for common options with their default values,
general configuration information, and an example complete configuration.

.. note::

    Unless you are changing to a non-default value, you do not need to
    specify any of the following configuration options.

searchlight-api.conf
--------------------

Plugin: OS::Designate::Zone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    [resource_plugin:os_designate_zone]
    enabled = true
    index_name = searchlight

Plugin: OS::Designate::RecordSet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    [resource_plugin:os_designate_recordset]
    enabled = true
    index_name = searchlight

.. warning::

    *OS::Designate::Zone* documents have a parent relationship to
    *OS::Designate::RecordSet* documents. Because of this you must have
    both *os_designate_zone* and *os_designate_recordset* plugin
    configurations enabled or disabled together and be set to the same
    index_name.

Designate Configuration
=======================

The Designate services must be configured properly to work with searchlight.

designate.conf
--------------

Notifications must be configured properly for searchlight to process
incremental updates. Use the following::

    notification_driver = messaging
    notification_topics = notifications,searchlight_indexer
    rpc_backend = 'rabbit'

Restart designate-central, designate-pool-manager, designate-zone-manager and
you should be good to go!

local.conf (devstack)
---------------------

.. note::

    Designate resource types are *not* enabled by default (``enabled = false``)
    in the Searchlight devstack script because Designate is not
    installed by default in devstack. If you have Designate installed in
    devstack, you have two options for enabling designate resource types in
    Searchlight:

    1. Prior to stacking: modify the searchlight post config section in
       ``local.conf`` by adding a ``[[post-config|$SEARCHLIGHT_CONF]]`` section.

    2. After stacking: manually edit the ``searchlight-api.conf`` file.

The Designate plugin must be enabled and run with devstack to include Designate
with your devstack deployment. Follow the instructions here:
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/designate/devstack.html

Additionally, make sure to enable notifications in local.conf with the
following::

  DESIGNATE_NOTIFICATION_TOPICS=notifications,searchlight_indexer
  DESIGNATE_NOTIFICATION_DRIVER=messaging

Release Notes
=============

0.1.0.0 (Liberty)
-----------------

For best results, use the v2 Designate API. Using the Designate v1 API to
create domains results in the Designate service not sending all possible
status change notifications. This causes Designate record set documents to
stay in the ``Pending`` status in the search index.

The Horizon UI uses the v1 API and causes the above issue to be seen.
So in order to ensure the search index contains the correct status values
for record sets when using Horizon, you may set up a cron job to
re-index Designate data.

You should use the ``--no-delete`` option to prevent the index from
temporarily not containing any data (which otherwise would happen with a full
bulk indexing job)::

    searchlight-manage index sync --type OS::Designate::Zone,OS::Designate::RecordSet --force --no-delete
