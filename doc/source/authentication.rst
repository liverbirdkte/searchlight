Keystone Authentication
=======================

Searchlight should be integrated with keystone. Setting this up is
relatively straightforward, as the keystone distribution includes the
necessary middleware. Once you have installed keystone and edited your
configuration files, users will need to have an authenticated keystone token
in all API requests. The keystone integration will allow both active denial
of requests from unauthenticated users and will also allow proper search
result filtering.

.. DANGER::
   If the API is not configured with keystone, all data indexed by
   searchlight is at risk of being accessed by unauthorized users.


Configuring the searchlight services to use keystone
----------------------------------------------------

Keystone is integrated with searchlight through the use of middleware.
The default configuration files for the Searchlight API use a single piece of
middleware called ``unauthenticated-context``, which generates a request
context containing blank authentication information. In order to configure
Searchlight to use Keystone, the ``authtoken`` and ``context`` middleware
must be deployed in place of the ``unauthenticated-context`` middleware.
The ``authtoken`` middleware performs the authentication token validation
and retrieves actual user authentication information. It can be found in
the keystone distribution. For more information, please refer to the Keystone
documentation on the ``auth_token`` middleware::

http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystonemiddleware/middlewarearchitecture.html

searchlight-api-paste.ini
`````````````````````````

First, ensure that declarations for the middleware exist in the
``searchlight-api-paste.ini`` file.  Here is an example for ``authtoken``::

  [pipeline:searchlight-keystone]
  pipeline = authtoken context rootapp

  [filter:authtoken]
  paste.filter_factory = keystonemiddleware.auth_token:filter_factory
  delay_auth_decision = true

searchlight-api.conf
````````````````````

You must then update the main ``searchlight-api.conf`` configuration file
to enable the keystone application pipeline.

Set ``flavor`` to ``keystone`` in the ``paste_deploy`` group::

  [paste_deploy]
  flavor = keystone

Set ``keystone_authtoken`` options. The following sets the searchlight
service user as the user for performing policy API authentication checks.
The actual options and values in this section will need to be set according
to your environment::

  [keystone_authtoken]
  auth_url = http://127.0.0.1:35357
  auth_plugin = password
  project_domain_id = default
  project_name = service
  user_domain_id = default
  password = <SERVICE_PASSWORD>
  username = searchlight

.. note::
  For development and unit testing, it is recommended to also set
  ``revocation_cache_timeout = 10`` under the ``keystone_authtoken`` group.

Set ``service_credentials`` options. Searchlight plugins may make API calls
to other services to index their data. Prior to doing this, it will get a
valid token based on the integration account credentials::

 [service_credentials]
 # These are needed to make API calls to other services when indexing
 auth_plugin = password
 username = searchlight
 password = <SERVICE_PASSWORD>
 tenant_name = service
 auth_url = http://127.0.0.1:35357

Service integration account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the above configuration implicitly uses a ``searchlight`` service user.
If you intend to use this user, it must have been created and registered with
keystone. Typically, this is done with the following commands (v3 keystone)::

  $ openstack project create --or-show service --property domain=default
  $ openstack user create searchlight --password <SERVICE_PASSWORD> --project service
  $ openstack role add admin --project service --user searchlight
